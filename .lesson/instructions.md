Before continuing, make sure that you have loaded
the sample data into your database.
Connect to your database using your unique 
connection string.

**1.** Using the sample_training.grades collection, 
print (console.log) out all of the documents to the console, sorted
in ascending order by `class_id`.

**2.** Using the sample_geospatial.shipwrecks collection,
print out all the documents that are `watlev: "always dry"`.
Only include the `chart` and `_id` field in the documents
returned by the query.

**3.** Using the sample_supplies.sales collection, print out 
all documents that correspond to purchases made online and 
in Austin. Sort the documents returned from most recent
to least recent in terms of sales date. Exclude the
`customer` field from your results.
